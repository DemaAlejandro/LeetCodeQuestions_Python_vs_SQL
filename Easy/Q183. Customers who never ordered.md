## Q183. Customers who never ordered
Table: `Customers`
| Column Name | Type |
|:---|:---|
| id | int |
| name | varchar |

`id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.

Table: `Orders`
| Column Name | Type |
|:---|:---|
| id | int |
| customerId | int |

`id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
`customerId` is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

---

Input: 
`Customers` table:
| id | name |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | Joe |
| 2 | Henry |
| 3 | Sam |
| 4 | Max |

`Orders` table:
| id | customerId |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 1 |

Output: 
| Customers |
|:---|
| Henry |
| Max |

---

## Solution in Python
``` python
import pandas as pd

def find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
  # Filter a df whose customers 'id' is NOT present in orders 'customersID' column
  df = customers[~customers['id'].isin(orders['customerId'])]
  # Build a df renamed with column 'name' as 'Customers' as the question asks.
  df = df[['name']].rename(columns={'name':'Customers'})
  return df
```
## Solution in SQL
``` sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
#Left join to ensure all customers are included even if they don't have any orders
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON o.customerID = c.id
WHERE o.customerID IS NULL
```
